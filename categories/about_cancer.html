        <br>
        Cancer is a condition where the cells in a part of your body start multiplying out of control.  These cancerous cells can invade and destroy surrounding tissue, including vital organs.  They can form tumours if they grow too much.
        <br>
        <br>
        1 in 2 people will get cancer in their lifetime.  In the UK, the four most common types of cancer are breast cancer, lung cancer, bowel cancer and prostrate cancer.  There are over 200 different types of cancer.  Each is diagnosed and treated differently.

        Spotting the signs of cancer is essential, as the earlier cancer is diagnosed, the higher chance of recovery.  Unusual, unexplained symptoms can be related to cancer and should be checked by a doctor.  For example, symptoms like unexplained bleeding, a lump suddenly appearing on your body or changes in bowel habits could all be early signs of cancer.
        <br>
        <br>
        Making simple changes to your lifestyle can greatly reduce your risk of cancer.  Changes like exercising regularly, not smoking and eating healthily can make a massive difference in terms of protecting you.
        <br>
        <br>
        The treatment for cancer depends on the type of cancer.  Cancer is usually treated through surgery, as solid tumours can be physically removed from the body.  Other treatments include chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
        <br>
        <br>
        In chemotherapy, the cancer is treated through the use of chemicals.
        <br>
        In radiotherapy, cancer is treated theough the controlled use of high-energy radiation.
